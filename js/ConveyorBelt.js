/* ConveyorBelt.js
 *
 * Constructs a queue that processes functions added to it
 * in intervals. This is useful for doing things like throttling
 * a deluge of rendering operations without missing any crucial 
 * steps.
 *
 * How to Use:
 *
 * var belt = new ConveyorBelt.ConveyorBelt(35) // msec or 'immediate'
 * 
 * while (something) {
 *	  belt.add(something.render()); // renders every 35msec until complete (not a hard guarantee)
 * }
 *
 * You can start, stop, flush, and burn down the queue at any time.
 *
 * Dependencies: None
